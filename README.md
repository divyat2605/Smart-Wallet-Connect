# Lottery Smart Contract

This is a simple lottery smart contract written in Solidity. It allows users to participate in a lottery by sending Ether, and the manager can pick a random winner from the participants.

## Features

- Users can participate in the lottery by sending exactly 1 Ether.
- The manager can pick a winner from the participants.
- The winner receives the entire balance of the contract.
- The list of participants is reset after each lottery round.
- Emits an event when a winner is picked for transparency.

## Installation

To deploy and interact with this contract, you need to have the following tools installed:

1. **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Truffle**: Install Truffle globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g truffle
   ```
3. **Ganache**: Download Ganache from [trufflesuite.com/ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) for local blockchain development.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lottery-smart-contract.git
   cd lottery-smart-contract
   ```

2. Compile the smart contract:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contract to a local blockchain (e.g., Ganache):
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

4. Interact with the contract using Truffle Console:
   ```bash
   truffle console
   ```

5. In the console, you can call functions like `participate`, `pickWinner`, etc.

## Contract Functions

### `constructor()`
Initializes the contract and sets the manager to the address that deploys it.

### `function participate() public payable`
Allows users to participate in the lottery by sending exactly 1 Ether.

### `function getBalance() public view returns (uint)`
Returns the current balance of the contract (only callable by the manager).

### `function random() internal view returns (uint)`
Generates a pseudo-random number based on block properties.

### `function pickWinner() public`
Allows the manager to pick a winner from the participants and transfer the balance to them.

## Security Considerations

- The randomness generation method used in this contract (`block.prevrandao`) is not secure against manipulation by miners. For production use, consider integrating Chainlink VRF for secure randomness.
- Ensure proper testing on test networks before deploying to mainnet.
